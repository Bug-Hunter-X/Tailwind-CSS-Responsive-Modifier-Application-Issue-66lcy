# Tailwind CSS Responsive Modifier Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the application of responsive modifiers in Tailwind CSS. The bug manifests as unexpected styling behavior across different screen sizes, particularly when dealing with nested components or complex class combinations.

## Bug Description

When using Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) within nested components or with numerous classes, the expected responsive styling doesn't always apply correctly.  This can lead to layout inconsistencies across different screen sizes.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Resize the browser window to observe the unexpected styling behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves careful organization of the Tailwind classes and potentially restructuring the HTML to avoid conflicts.  Review the `bugSolution.html` file for the corrected implementation.  This often involves a more deliberate approach to managing responsive styles, potentially using more specific class names and carefully considering the order in which classes are applied.
