The solution involves restructuring the HTML to ensure that the Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers are applied correctly.  Instead of relying on a single, complex class string, it's best to separate out the responsive styles into distinct classes. This simplifies debugging and improves readability.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  <span class="sm:px-8 md:py-4 lg:text-xl">Click Me</span>
</button>
```

This revised structure clearly separates base styles from responsive modifiers, minimizing potential conflicts.  Alternatively, consider using Tailwind's `@responsive` directives for more complex scenarios.  Ensure that your responsive classes are applied in the correct order and that there are no conflicting classes that override your intended styling.
